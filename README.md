# mobx-introduction

This code has been used as an introduction to MobX during a [ReactJS meetup in Munich on 10.01.2017](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Meetup-Munich/events/236376351/).

It includes two small samples:

* [`mobx-alone` - Demonstrates the usage of MobX without React](mobx-alone)
* [`mobx-react-introduction` - A small sample of MobX observables used together with React](mobx-react-introduction)
